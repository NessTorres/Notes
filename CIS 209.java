Computational Thinking
	Algorithmic Thinking
	{
		Simple arithmatic sequences - 43+39 = 
			1. Add 3 to 9 == 12
			2. Write the 2 of the 12 under the line
			3. If more than one digit (12), carry the tenth place above 
			4. Add all numbers in collumn; 1+4+3 = 8
			5. Carry the 8 below the line - Answer is 43+39 == 82
	}
	Evaluation
	Deomposition
	{
		
	}
	Abstraction
	{
		Representation of something that is real (touch, smell, hear)
			A certain number of apples may be represented by integers or for computers, binary
	}
	Generalization
	{
		Convert algorithm to work with any other problem similar to it.	
	}
	Behavioral skills (Persistent/Creativity)
	{
		"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." - Albert Einstein

When writing an algorithm, there are multiple correct answeres. When generalizing the algorithm, you can refine it by adding
